# twinsgrid

This is a web page for tracking a weekly pool among 25 coworkers. The outcome each week is determined by summing the total runs scored by the Minnesota Twins, and the total runs scored by their opponents, and taking the last digit of each.  Each participant is given two numbers for the Twins and two numbers for their opponents.  For example, if the Twins score 32 runs in a week, and their opponents score 28 runs that week, and I have number 2 for the Twins and 8 for their opponents, I would win that week's contest.
